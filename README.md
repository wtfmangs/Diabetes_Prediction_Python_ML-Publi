Diabetes Prediction Website which has the applications of Machine Learning Model.
Diabetes Predictor > Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning. In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like *Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI*. We will perform all the steps from *Data gathering to Model deployment.* During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework. # Installation 1. Clone this repository and unzip it. 2. After downloading, `cd` into the `flask` directory. 3. Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it. 4. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 5. Delete the "model.pkl" file if exists already 6. Run the "model.py" file: `python model.py` 7. Execute the command: `python app.py` 8. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.# Diabetes_Prediction_Python_ML
